# Build Guide

This document will go through the assembly of the EuroPi module.  
If you have bought only a Panel + PCB kit, you will need to also buy all of the components found in the [bill of materials](hardware/bill_of_materials.md).
  
## Required tools
- Soldering Iron + Solder
- Wire Snips / Scissors
- Multimeter (Very nice to have but non-essential)
- Two unique voltage sources within the range 0-10V (Only necessary if you wish to calibrate the module for increased accuracy)

## Assembly Preparation

Before you begin assembly, I reccommend first grouping your components into these categories, either in little bags or just on the top of your work surface.  
You have likely already checked your Bill of Materials, but I would still suggest double checking that you have the specified number of each component in each category to prevent any disappointment half-way through the build.

A simple small stand for your OLED display. Helps hold it in place while soldering and keeps it sug against the face.

Print upside down for best results/least amount of supports. Should print very quickly on most printers. It takes 30 minutes on my Ender3 Pro.

The 'parametric-ish' Blender file is included in case you'd like to mod it.

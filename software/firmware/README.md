# Firmware

Please download the most recent MicroPython firmware from [the MicroPython website](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/).
  
The 'flashnuke.uf2' file is a last resort, and will wipe all data stored on your Pico, including calibration data and custom programs.  
It is only to be used when all other troubleshooting options have been covered, as found in [troubleshooting.md](https://github.com/Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi/blob/main/troubleshooting.md)

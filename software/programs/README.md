# Programs

This folder contains programs written by me (Rory) for the EuroPi, using the europi.py library.  
You will need to have this library installed on your EuroPi to use any of these programs, along with the SSD1306 module.  
Instructions on how to install both of these can be found in [programming_instructions.md](/software/programming_instructions.md).  

The europi.py library is often updated, and there is a chance that some of these updates may cause issues with older programs. I'll always try to rectify these at the same time as pushing the europi.py update, but if there are any I have missed, please add the bug as an [Issue](https://github.com/Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi/issues) on GitHub
